## Hi there 👋

I'm Jan, a trained Molecular Biologist and Data Scientist with 5 years of experience in clinical
research. I'm currently enrolled in LeWagons Data Science and AI Bootcamp. I'm highly interested in the combination of Biology (especially Molecular and Systems Biology) and Data Science to help to improve health research!

- 💬 Ask me about anything you want! However, I can only provide answers to Biology, (easy) Data Science questions and Football (the real thing! ⚽️)
- 📫 How to reach me: Just shoot me a message on LinkedIn or write me a mail here: jan.rene.haak@gmail.com
